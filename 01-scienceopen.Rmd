Research practices directly affect the epistemological pursuit of
science: Responsible conduct of research affirms it; research
misconduct undermines it. Typically, a responsible scientist is
conceptualized as objective, meticulous, skeptical, rational, and not
subject to external incentives such as prestige or social
pressure. Research misconduct, on the other hand, is formally defined
(e.g., in regulatory documents) as three types of condemned,
intentional behaviors: fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism
[@ostp2000]. Research practices that are neither conceptualized as
responsible nor defined as research misconduct could be considered
questionable research practices, which are practices that are
detrimental to the research process
[@doi:10.17226/1864;@doi:10.1007/pl00022268]. For example, the
misapplication of statistical methods can increase the number of false
results and is therefore not responsible. At the same time, such
misapplication can also not be deemed research misconduct because it
falls outside the defined scope of FFP. Such undefined and potentially
questionable research practices have been widely discussed in the
field of psychology in recent years
[@doi:10.1177/0956797611430953;@doi:10.1080/1047840X.2012.692215;@doi:10.1177/1745691612459058;@doi:10.1126/science.aac4716;@doi:10.1177/0956797611417632].

This chapter discusses the [responsible conduct of
research](#responsible-conduct-of-research), [questionable research
practices](#questionable-research-practices), and [research
misconduct](#research-misconduct). For each of these three, we extend
on what it means, what researchers currently do, and how it can be
facilitated (i.e., responsible conduct) or prevented (i.e.,
questionable practices and research misconduct). These research
practices encompass the entire research practice spectrum proposed by
@doi:10.1007/pl00022268, where responsible conduct of research is the
ideal behavior at one end, FFP the worst behavior on the other end,
with (potentially) questionable practices in between.

## Responsible conduct of research

### What is it?

Responsible conduct of research is often defined in terms of a set of
abstract, normative principles. One such set of norms of good science
[@doi:10.1353/jhe.0.0095;@merton1942] is accompanied by a set of counternorms
[@doi:10.1353/jhe.0.0095;@doi:10.2307/2094423] that promulgate irresponsible research.
These six norms and counternorms can serve as a valuable framework to
reflect on the behavior of a researcher and are included in Table \@ref(tab:normtable).

```{r normtable, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}

library(magrittr)
norms <- read.csv('assets/tables/norm-table.csv', header = TRUE)
names(norms)[2] <- 'Description norm'

if (!knitr::is_html_output()) {
knitr::kable(norms, format = 'latex',
             caption = "Six norms of responsible conduct of research and their respective
  counternorms.", booktabs = TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c('striped', 'scale_down', 'hold_position'))
} else {
knitr::kable(norms,
             caption = "Six norms of responsible conduct of research and their respective
  counternorms.", booktabs = TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive", full_width = F))
}
```


Besides abiding by these norms, responsible conduct of research consists
of both research integrity and research ethics [@isbn:9780199376025]. Research
integrity is the adherence to professional standards and rules that are
well defined and uniform, such as the standards outlined by the
@apa2010. Research ethics, on the other hand, is "the critical study of
the moral problems associated with or that arise in the course of
pursuing research" [@doi:10.1007/pl00022268], which is abstract and pluralistic. As
such, research ethics is more fluid than research integrity and is
supposed to fill in the gaps left by research integrity
[@doi:10.1080/08989620600848611]. For example, not fabricating data is the professional
standard in research, but research ethics informs us on why it is wrong
to fabricate data. This highlights that ethics and integrity are not the
same, but rather two related constructs. Discussion or education should
therefore not only reiterate the professional standards, but also
include training on developing ethical and moral principles that can
guide researchers in their decision-making.

### What do researchers do?

Even though most researchers subscribe to the aforementioned normative
principles, fewer researchers actually adhere to them in practice and
many researchers perceive their scientific peers to adhere to them even
less. A survey of 3,247 researchers by @doi:10.1525/jer.2007.2.4.3 indicated that
researchers subscribed to the norms more than they actually behaved in
accordance to these norms. For instance, a researcher may be committed
to sharing their data (the norm of communality), but might shy away
from actually sharing data at an early stage out of a fear of being
scooped by other researchers. This result aligns with surveys showing
that many researchers express a willingness to share data, but often
fail to do so when asked [@doi:10.1080/08989621.2012.678688;@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0007078]. Moreover,
although researchers admit they do not adhere to the norms as much as
they subscribe to them, they still regard themselves as adhering to the
norms more so than their peers. For counternorms, this pattern reversed.
These results indicate that researchers systematically evaluate their
own conduct as more responsible than other researchers' conduct.

This gap between subscription and actual adherence to the normative
principles is called normative dissonance and could potentially be due
to substandard academic education or lack of open discussion on ethical
issues. @doi:10.1097/ACM.0b013e31812f764c suggested that different types of mentoring
affect the normative behavior by a researcher. Most importantly, ethics
mentoring (e.g., discussing whether a mistake that does not affect
conclusions should result in a corrigendum) might promote adherence to
the norms, whereas survival mentoring (e.g., advising not to submit a
non-crucial corrigendum because it could be bad for your scientific
reputation) might promote adherence to the counternorms. Ethics
mentoring focuses on discussing ethical issues [@doi:10.1097/ACM.0b013e31812f764c] that
might facilitate higher adherence to norms due to increased
self-reflection, whereas survival mentoring focuses on how to thrive in
academia and focuses on building relationships and specific skills to
increase the odds of being successful.

### Improving responsible conduct

Increasing exposure to ethics education throughout the research career
might improve responsible research conduct. Research indicated that
weekly 15-minute ethics discussions facilitated confidence in
recognizing ethical problems in a way that participants deemed both
effective and enjoyable [@doi:10.1007/s11948-010-9197-3]. Such forms of active education
are fruitful because they teach researchers practical skills that can
change their research conduct and improve prospective decision making,
where a researcher rapidly assesses the potential outcomes and ethical
implications of the decision at hand, instead of in hindsight
[@doi:10.1007/s11948-001-0012-z]. It is not to be expected that passive education on
guidelines should be efficacious in producing behavioral change
[@doi:10.1097/ACM.0b013e318257ee6a], considering that participants rarely learn about useful
skills or experience a change in attitudes as a consequence of such
passive education [@doi:10.1007/s11948-006-0055-2].

Moreover, in order to accommodate the normative principles of scientific
research, the professional standards, and a researcher's moral
principles, transparent research practices can serve as a framework for
responsible conduct of research. Transparency in research embodies the
normative principles of scientific research: universalism is promoted by
improved documentation; communalism is promoted by publicly sharing
research; disinterestedness is promoted by increasing accountability and
exposure of potential conflicts of interest; skepticism is promoted by
allowing for verification of results; governance is promoted by improved
project management by researchers; higher quality is promoted by the
other norms. Professional standards also require transparency. For
instance, the APA and publication contracts require researchers to share
their data with other researchers [@apa2010]. Even though authors often
make their data available upon request, such requests frequently fail
[@doi:10.1080/08989621.2012.678688;@doi:10.1037/0003-066x.61.7.726], which results in a failure to adhere to
professional standards. Openness regarding the choices made (e.g., on
how to analyze the data) during the research process will promote active
discussion of prospective ethics, increasing self-reflective capacities
of both the individual researcher and the collective evaluation of the
research (e.g., peer reviewers).

In the remainder of this section we outline a type of project
management, founded on transparency, which seems apt to be the new
standard within psychology [@doi:10.1080/1047840X.2012.692215;@doi:10.1177/1745691612459058]. Transparency
guidelines for journals have also been proposed [@doi:10.1126/science.aab2374] and the
outlined project management adheres to these guidelines from an author's
perspective. The provided format focuses on empirical research and is
certainly not the only way to apply transparency to adhere to
responsible conduct of research principles.

#### Transparent project management

Research files can be easily managed by creating an online project at
the Open Science Framework (OSF; [osf.io](https://osf.io)). The OSF is free to
use and provides extensive project management facilities to encourage
transparent research. Project management via this tool has been tried
and tested in, for example, the Many Labs project [@doi:10.1027/1864-9335/a000178] and the
Reproducibility project [@doi:10.1126/science.aac4716]. Research files can be manually
uploaded by the researcher or automatically synchronized (e.g., via
Dropbox or Github). Using the OSF is easy and explained in-depth at
[osf.io/getting-started](https://osf.io/getting-started).

The OSF provides the tools to manage a research project, but how to
apply these tools still remains a question. Such online management of
materials, information, and data, is preferred above a more informal
system lacking in transparency that often strongly rests on particular
contributor's implicit knowledge.

As a way to organize a version-controlled project, we suggest a
'prune-and-add' template, where the major elements of most research
projects are included but which can be specified and extended for
specific projects. This template includes folders as specified in Table \@ref(tab:prune-and-add), which covers many of the research stages. The template
can be readily duplicated and adjusted on the OSF for practical use in
similar projects (like replication studies;
[osf.io/4sdn3](https://osf.io/4sdn3)).

```{r prune-and-add, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
prune <- read.csv('assets/tables/prune-and-add.csv', header = TRUE)
names(prune)[2] <- 'Summary of contents'

if (!knitr::is_html_output()) {
knitr::kable(prune, format = 'latex',
             caption = "Project management folder structure, which can be pruned and added to in order to meet specific research needs. This folder structure can be duplicated as an OSF project at https://osf.io/4sdn3.",
  booktabs=TRUE) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = c('striped', 'hold_position', 'scale_down'))
} else {
knitr::kable(prune,
             caption = "Project management folder structure, which can be pruned and added to in order to meet specific research needs. This folder structure can be duplicated as an OSF project at https://osf.io/4sdn3.",
  booktabs=TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive", full_width = F))
}
```

This suggested project structure also includes a folder to include
preregistration files of hypotheses, analyses, and research design. The
preregistration of these ensures that the researcher does not
hypothesize after the results are known [@doi:10.1207/s15327957pspr0203_4], but also ensures
readers that the results presented as confirmatory were actually
confirmatory [@doi:10.1111/add.12728;@doi:10.1177/1745691612463078]. The preregistration of
analyses also ensures that the statistical analysis chosen to test the
hypothesis was not dependent on the result. Such preregistrations
document the chronology of the research process and also ensure that
researchers actively reflect on the decisions they make prior to running
a study, such that the quality of the research might be improved.

Also available in this project template is a file to specify
contributions to a research project. This is important for determining
authorship, responsibility, and credit of the research project. With
more collaborations occurring throughout science and increasing
specialization, researchers cannot be expected to carry responsibility
for the entirety of large multidisciplinary papers, but authorship does
currently imply this. Consequently, authorship has become a too
imprecise measure for specifying contributions to a research project and
requires a more precise approach.

Besides structuring the project and documenting the contributions,
responsible conduct encourages independent verification of the results
to reduce particularism. A co-pilot model has been introduced previously
[@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0114876;@doi:10.1038/480007a], where at least two researchers
independently run all analyses based on the raw data. Such verification
of research results enables streamline reproduction of the results by
outsiders (e.g., are all files readily available? are the files properly
documented? do the analyses work on someone else's computer?), helps
find out potential errors [@doi:10.3758/s13428-011-0089-5;@doi:10.3758/s13428-015-0664-2], and increases
confidence in the results. We therefore encourage researchers to
incorporate such a co-pilot model into all empirical research projects.

## Questionable research practices 

### What is it?

Questionable research practices are defined as practices that are
detrimental to the research process [@doi:10.17226/1864]. Examples include
inadequate research documentation, failing to retain research data for a
sufficient amount of time, and actively refusing access to published
research materials. However, questionable research practices should not
be confounded with questionable academic practices, such as academic
power play, sexism, and scooping.

Attention for questionable practices in psychology has (re-)arisen in
recent years, in light of the so-called "replication crisis" [@doi:10.1177/1745691612460688].
Pinpointing which factors initiated doubts about the reproducibility of
findings is difficult, but most notable seems an increased awareness of
widely accepted practices as statistically and methodologically
questionable.

Besides affecting the reproducibility of psychological science,
questionable research practices align with the aforementioned
counternorms in science. For instance, confirming prior beliefs by
selectively reporting results is a form of dogmatism; skepticism and
communalism are violated by not providing peers with research materials
or details of the analysis; universalism is hindered by lack of research
documentation; governance is deteriorated when the public loses its
trust in the research system because of signs of the effects of
questionable research practices (e.g., repeated failures to replicate)
and politicians initiate new forms of oversight.

Suppose a researcher fails to find the (a priori) hypothesized effect,
subsequently decides to inspect the effect for each gender, and finds an
effect only for women. Such an ad hoc exploration of the data is
perfectly fine if it were presented as an exploration [@doi:10.1007/s11336-015-9445-1].
However, if the subsequent publication only mentions the effect for
females and presents it as confirmatory, instead of exploratory, this is
questionable. The $p$-values should have been corrected for multiple
testing (three hypotheses rather than one were tested) and the result is
clearly not as convincing as one that would have been hypothesized a
priori.

These biases occur in part because researchers, editors, and
peer reviewers are biased to believe that statistical significance has a
bearing on the probability of a hypothesis being true. Such
misinterpretation of the $p$-value is not uncommon [@doi:10.1037/0003-066X.49.12.997]. The
perception that statistical significance bears on the probability of a
hypothesis reflects an essentialist view of $p$-values rather than a
stochastic one; the belief that if an effect exists, the data will
mirror this with a small $p$-value [@doi:10.1007/s11336-015-9444-2]. Such problematic
beliefs enhance publication bias, because researchers are less likely to
believe in their results and are less likely submit their work for
publication [@doi:10.1126/science.1255484]. This enforces the counternorm of secrecy by
keeping nonsignificant results in the file-drawer [@doi:10.1037/0033-2909.86.3.638],
which in turn greatly biases the picture emerging from the literature.

### What do researchers do?

Most questionable research practices are hard to retrospectively detect,
but one questionable research practice, the misreporting of statistical
significance, can be readily estimated and could provide some indication
of how widespread questionable practices might be. Errors that result in
the incorrect conclusion that a result is significant are often called
gross errors, which indicates that the decision error had substantive
effects. Large scale research in psychology has indicated that 12.5-20%
of sampled articles include at least one such gross error, with
approximately 1% of all reported test results being affected by such
gross errors [@doi:10.3758/s13428-011-0089-5;@doi:10.3758/s13428-015-0664-2;@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0114876].

Nonetheless, the prevalence of questionable research practices remains
largely unknown and reproducibility of findings has been shown to be
problematic. In one large-scale project, only 36% of findings published
in three main psychology journals in a given year could be replicated
[@doi:10.1126/science.aac4716]. Effect sizes were smaller in the replication than in the
original study in 80% of the studies, and it is quite possible that this
low replication rate and decrease in effect sizes are mostly due to
publication bias and the use of questionable research practices in the
original studies.

### How can it be prevented?

Counternorms such as self-interestedness, dogmatism, and particularism
are discouraged by transparent practices because practices that arise
from them will become more apparent to scientific peers.

Therefore transparency guidelines have been proposed and signed by
editors of over 500 journals [@doi:10.1126/science.aab2374]. To different degrees,
signatories of these guidelines actively encourage, enforce, and reward
data sharing, material sharing, preregistration of hypotheses or
analyses, and independent verification of results. The effects of these
guidelines are not yet known, considering their recent introduction.
Nonetheless, they provide a strong indication that the awareness of
problems is trickling down into systemic changes that prevent
questionable practices.

Most effective might be preregistrations of research design, hypotheses,
and analyses, which reduce particularism of results by providing an a
priori research scheme. It also outs behaviors such as the
aforementioned optional stopping, where extra participants are sampled
until statistical significance is reached [@doi:10.2307/2343787] or the dropping of conditions or outcome variables
[@doi:10.1177/1948550615598377]. Knowing that researchers outlined their research process
and seeing it adhered to helps ensure readers that results are
confirmatory – rather than exploratory of nature, when results are
presented as confirmatory [@doi:10.1177/1745691612463078], ensuring researchers that
questionable practices did not culminate in those results.

Moreover, use of transparent practices even allows for unpublished
research to become discoverable, effectively eliminating publication
bias. Eliminating publication bias would make the research system an
estimated 30 times more efficient [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0084896]. Considering that
unpublished research is not indexed in the familiar peer reviewed
databases, infrastructures to search through repositories similar to the
OSF are needed. One such infrastructure is being built by the Center for
Open Science (SHARE; [osf.io/share](https://osf.io/share)), which searches
through repositories similar to the OSF (e.g., figshare, Dryad, arXiv).

## Research misconduct

### What is it?

[As mentioned at the beginning of the article](#introduction), research misconduct has
been defined as fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism (FFP).
However, it does not include "honest error or differences of opinion"
[@ostp2000;@doi:10.1080/08989621.2012.650948]. Fabrication is the making up of data sets
entirely. Falsification is the adjustment of a set of data points to
ensure the wanted results. Plagiarism is the direct reproduction of
other's creative work without properly attributing it. These behaviors
are condemned by many institutions and organizations, including the
@apa2010.

Research misconduct is clearly the worst type of research practice, but
despite it being clearly wrong, it can be approached from a scientific
and legal perspective [@doi:10.1038/488591b]. The scientific perspective
condemns research misconduct because it undermines the pursuit for
knowledge. Fabricated or falsified data are scientifically useless
because they do not add any knowledge that can be trusted. Use of
fabricated or falsified data is detrimental to the research process and
to knowledge building. It leads other researchers or practitioners
astray, potentially leading to waste of research resources when pursuing
false insights or unwarranted use of such false insights in professional
or educational practice.

The legal perspective sees research misconduct as a form of white-collar
crime, although in practice it is typically not subject to criminal law
but rather to administrative or labor law. The legal perspective
requires intention to commit research misconduct, whereas the scientific
perspective requires data to be collected as described in a research
report, regardless of intent. In other words, the legal perspective
seeks to answer the question "was misconduct committed with intent and
by whom?"

The scientific perspective seeks to answer the question "were results
invalidated because of the misconduct?" For instance, a paper reporting
data that could not have been collected with the materials used in the
study (e.g., the reported means lie outside the possible values on the
psychometric scale) is invalid scientifically. The impossible results
could be due to research misconduct but also due to honest error.

Hence, a legal verdict of research misconduct requires proof that a
certain researcher falsified or fabricated the data. The scientific
assessment of the problems is often more straightforward than the legal
assessment of research misconduct. The former can be done by peer
reviewers, whereas the latter involves regulations and a well-defined
procedure allowing the accused to respond to the accusations.

Throughout this part of the article, we focus on data fabrication and
falsification, which we will illustrate with examples from the Diederik
Stapel case — a case we are deeply familiar with. His fraudulent
activities resulted in 58 retractions (as of May, 2016), making this the
largest known research misconduct case in the social sciences.

### What do researchers do?

Given that research misconduct represents such a clear violation of the
normative structure of science, it is difficult to study how many
researchers commit research misconduct and why they do it. Estimates
based on self-report surveys suggest that around 2% of researchers admit
to having fabricated or falsified data during their career
[@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0005738]. Although the number of retractions due to misconduct has
risen in the last decades, both across the sciences in general
[@doi:10.1073/pnas.1212247109] and in psychology in particular [@doi:10.1026/0033-3042/a000247], this number
still represents a fairly low number in comparison to the total number
of articles in the literature [@wicherts2016]. Similarly, the number of
researchers found guilty of research misconduct is relatively low,
suggesting that many cases of misconduct go undetected; the actual rate
of research misconduct is unknown. Little research has addressed why
researchers fabricate or falsify data, but it is commonly accepted that
they do so out of self-interest in order to obtain publications and
further their career. What we know from some exposed cases, however, is
that fabricated or falsified data are often quite extraordinary and so
could sometimes be exposed as not being genuine.

Humans, including researchers, are quite bad in recognizing and
fabricating probabilistic processes [@doi:10.1080/08989620212969;@doi:10.1080/08989629508573866]. For
instance, humans frequently think that, after five coin flips that
result in heads, the probability of the next coin flip is more likely to
be tails than heads; the gambler's fallacy [@doi:10.1126/science.185.4157.1124]. Inferential
testing is based on sampling; by extension variables should be of
probabilistic origin and have certain stochastic properties. Because
humans have problems adhering to these probabilistic principles,
fabricated data is likely to lead to data that does not properly adhere
to the probabilistic origins at some level of the data [@Haldane1948-nm].

Exemplary of this lack of fabricating probabilistic processes is a table
in a now retracted paper from the Stapel case
[@doi:10.1177/0956797612453137;@doi:10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02128.x]. In the original Table 1, reproduced here
as Figure \@ref(fig:ruys), 32 means and standard deviations are presented.
*Fifteen* of these cells are duplicates of another cell (e.g., "0.87
(0.74)" occurs three times). Finding exact duplicates is extremely rare
for even one case, if the variables are a result of probabilistic
processes as in sampling theory.

```{r ruys, fig.cap="Reproduction of Table 1 from the retracted Ruys and Stapel (2008) paper. The table shows 32 cells with 'M (SD)', of which 15 are direct duplicates of one of the other cells. The original version with highlighted duplicates can be found at https://osf.io/89mcn.", out.width="100%", fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}
par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0))
knitr::include_graphics('assets/figures/scienceopen-table3.png', auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

Why reviewers and editors did not detect this remains a mystery, but it
seems that they simply do not pay attention to potential indicators of
misconduct in the publication process [@doi:10.1007/s11192-007-1950-2]. Similar issues
with blatantly problematic results in papers that were later found to be
due to misconduct have been noted in the medical sciences
[@doi:10.1038/325207a0]. Science has been regarded as a self-correcting system
based on trust. This aligns with the idea that misconduct occurs because
of "bad apples" (i.e., individual factors) and not because of a "bad
barrel" (i.e., systemic factors), increasing trust in the scientific
enterprise. However, the self-correcting system has been called a myth
[@doi:10.1177/1745691612460687] and an assumption that instigates complacency
[@doi:10.1038/4661040b]; if reviewers and editors have no criteria that pertain
to fabrication and falsification [@doi:10.1007/s11192-007-1950-2], this implies that the
current publication process is not always functioning properly as a
self-correcting mechanism. Moreover, trust in research as a
self-correcting system can be accompanied with complacency by colleagues
in the research process.

The most frequent way data fabrication is detected is by those
researchers who are scrutinous, which ultimately results in
whistleblowing. For example, Stapel's misdeeds were detected by young
researchers who were brave enough to blow the whistle. Although many
regulations include clauses that help protect the whistleblowers,
whistleblowing is known to represent a risk [@lubalin1995], not only
because of potential backlash but also because the perpetrator is often
closely associated with the whistleblower, potentially leading to
negative career outcomes such as retracted articles on which one is
co-author. This could explain why whistleblowers remain anonymous in
only an estimated 8% of the cases [@doi:10.1097/00001888-199805000-00009]. Negative actions as a
result of loss of anonymity include not only potential loss of a
position, but also social and mental health problems
[@doi:10.1007/s11948-999-0014-9;@doi:10.1080/08989621.2013.822249]. It seems plausible to assume that therefore
not all suspicions are reported.

How often data fabrication and falsification occur is an important
question that can be answered in different ways; it can be approached as
incidence or as prevalence. Incidence refers to new cases in a certain
timeframe, whereas prevalence refers to all cases in the population at a
certain time point. Misconduct cases are often widely publicized, which
might create the image that more cases occur, but the number of cases
seems relatively stable [@rhoades2004]. Prevalence of research
misconduct is of great interest and, as aforementioned, a meta-analysis
indicated that around 2% of surveyed researchers admit to fabricating or
falsifying research at least once [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0005738].

The prevalence that is of greatest interest is that of how many research
papers contain data that have been fabricated or falsified. Systematic
data on this are unavailable, because papers are not evaluated to this
end in an active manner [@doi:10.1007/s11192-007-1950-2]. Only one case study exists: the
Journal of Cell Biology evaluates all research papers for cell image
manipulation [@doi:10.1083/jcb.200406019;@doi:10.1128/mbio.00809-16], a form of data
fabrication/falsification. They have found that approximately 1% of all
research papers that passed peer review (out of total of over 3000
submissions) were not published because of the detection of image
manipulation [@cellbio2015].

### How can it be prevented?

Notwithstanding discussion about reconciliation of researchers who have
been found guilty of research misconduct [@doi:10.1038/493147a], these
researchers typically leave science after having been exposed. Hence,
improving the chances of detecting misconduct may help not only in the
correction of the scientific record, but also in the prevention of
research misconduct. In this section we discuss how the detection of
fabrication and falsification might be improved and what to do when
misconduct is detected.

When research is suspect of data fabrication or falsification,
whistleblowers can report these suspicions to institutions, professional
associations, and journals. For example, institutions can launch
investigations via their integrity offices. Typically, a complaint is
submitted to the research integrity officer, who subsequently decides
whether there are sufficient grounds for further investigation. In the
United States, integrity officers have the possibility to sequester,
that is to retrieve, all data of the person in question. If there is
sufficient evidence, a formal misconduct investigation or even a federal
misconduct investigation by the Office of Research Integrity might be
started. Professional associations can also launch some sort of
investigation, if the complaint is made to the association and the
respondent is a member of that association. Journals are also confronted
with complaints about specific research papers and those affiliated with
the Committee on Publication Ethics have a protocol for dealing with
these kinds of allegations (see
[publicationethics.org/resources](https://publicationethics.org/resources) for
details). The best way to improve detection of data fabrication directly
is to further investigate suspicions and report them to your research
integrity office, albeit the potential negative consequences should be
kept in mind when reporting the suspicions, such that it is best to
report anonymously and via analog mail (digital files contain metadata
with identifying information).

More indirectly, statistical tools can be applied to evaluate the
veracity of research papers and raw data [@doi:10.1111/anae.13126;@peeters2015],
which helps detect potential lapses of conduct. Statistical tools have
been successfully applied in data fabrication cases, for instance the
Stapel case [@levelt2012], the Fujii case [@doi:10.1111/j.1365-2044.2012.07128.x], and in the
cases of Smeesters and Sanna [@doi:10.1177/0956797613480366]. Interested readers are
referred to @buyse1999 for a review of statistical methods to detect
potential data fabrication.

Besides using statistics to monitor for potential problems, authors and
principal investigators are responsible for results in the paper and
therefore should invest in verification of results, which improves
earlier detection of problems even if these problems are the result of
mere sloppiness or honest error. Even though it is not feasible for all
authors to verify all results, ideally results should be verified by at
least one co-author. As mentioned earlier, peer review does not weed out
all major problems [@doi:10.1007/s11192-007-1950-2] and should not be trusted blindly.

Institutions could facilitate detection of data fabrication and
falsification by implementing data auditing. Data auditing is the
independent verification of research results published in a paper
[@doi:10.1038/439784c]. This goes hand-in-hand with co-authors verifying results,
but this is done by a researcher not directly affiliated with the
research project. Auditing data is common practice in research that is
subject to governmental oversight, for instance drug trials that are
audited by the Food and Drug Administration [@doi:10.1001/jamainternmed.2014.7774].

Papers that report fabricated or falsified data are typically retracted.
The decision to retract is often (albeit not necessarily) made after the
completion of a formal inquiry and/or investigation of research
misconduct by the academic institution, employer, funding organization
and/or oversight body. Because much of the academic work is done for
hire, the employer can request a retraction from the publisher of the
journal in which the article appeared. Often, the publisher then
consults with the editor (and sometimes also with proprietary
organizations like the professional society that owns the journal title)
to decide on whether to retract. Such processes can be legally complex
if the researcher who was guilty of research misconduct opposes the
retraction. The retraction notice ideally should provide readers with
the main reasons for the retraction, although quite often the notices
lack necessary information [@doi:10.1038/478026a]. The popular blog
Retraction Watch normally reports on retractions and often provides
additional information on the reasons for retraction that other parties
involved in the process (co-authors, whistleblowers, the accused
researcher, the (former) employer, and the publisher) are sometimes
reluctant to provide [@doi:10.1128/jmbe.v15i2.855]. In some cases, the editors of a
journal may decide to publish an editorial expression of concern if
there are sufficient grounds to doubt the data in a paper that is being
subjected to a formal investigation of research misconduct.

Many retracted articles are still cited after the retraction has been
issued [@doi:10.1007/s11948-015-9680-y;@doi:10.1001/jama.1990.03440100140020]. Additionally, retractions might
be issued following a misconduct investigation, resulting in no action taken by
journals, the original content simply being deleted wholesale, or subsequent legal
threats if the work would be retracted [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0085846]. If retractions
do not occur even though they have been issued, their negative effect,
for instance decreased author citations [@doi:10.1038/srep03146], are nullified,
reducing the costs of committing misconduct.

## Conclusion

This chapter provides an overview of the research practice spectrum,
where on the one end there is [responsible conduct of research](#responsible-conduct-of-research) and with
[research misconduct](#research-misconduct) on the other end. In sum, transparent research
practices are proposed to embody scientific norms and a way to deal with
both questionable research practices and research misconduct, [inducing
better research practices](#improving-responsible-conduct). This would improve not only the documentation
and verification of research results; it also helps create a more open
environment for researchers to actively discuss ethical problems and
handle problems in a responsible manner, promoting good research
practices. This might help reduce both questionable research practices
and research misconduct.
