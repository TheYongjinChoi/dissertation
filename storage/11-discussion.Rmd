<!-- ====================== -->

As a society, we look to science to solve pressing issues, but its
capability to do so is affected by those same issues in science,
society, and their interaction. Without radical and encompassing
reform, we risk a stalemate between them, or worse, regress on
both. In this Epilogue, I propose a high level framework for anyone to
make radical proposals to improve the sustainability of the scientific
system moving forward. This framework is the accumulation of the work that
spans this book, with Chapters 8 and 9 as its direct result.

One issue, for example, is the relative budget shrinkage of scientific
funding and the increased drive for excellence. These interact to
intensify the competition among scientists and feeds a publication
frenzy, which instigates a race to the bottom of validity of science
and mental health of the scientist.

We cannot tackle the issues the scientific system grapples with,
without changing the societal systems that shape it. The other way
around, we cannot neglect the impact the scientific system has on
societal issues. <!-- hier nog een voorbeeld --> The effect of the
scientific system on the societal issue of global warming is one
example. Scientists fly to conferences around the world in large
numbers, contributing large amounts of emissions
[@doi:10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.04.109], and labs produce large amounts
of waste, where one lab estimates using approximately 1 ton of
single-use plastic per researcher per year [@doi:10.1038/528479c].

https://www.timeshighereducation.com/comment/the-10-commandments-for-influencing-policymakers
--> These are only two of the many interactions between issues of
science and society. Other issues include that access to publications
is so limited, many people resort to illegitimate means to gain access
for legitimate purposes [@doi:10.1126/science.352.6285.508]. [It also
happens that governments seek university interns to get
access](https://therostrumblog.wordpress.com/2015/01/12/why-all-phd-students-should-do-a-policy-placement/)
to inform policy. Additionally, in an attempt to manage the risks Open
Access poses to their subscription models, the highly centralized
oligarchy of academic publishers are shifting to business models
resembling the problematic and data-exploitative models of
Facebook. But even for the researchers, the cost to play in publishing
Open Access is substantial and rising faster than inflation,
reaffirming structural and global inequalities. This further extends
inequalities in participation such as participation in scientific
education, which is increasingly difficult as collective financing
programs are replaced with individualized debt. Moreover, these issues
do not even begin to deal with biased publication of results based on
their statistical results, which distorts knowledge production. If the
studied effects are not large (the low hanging fruit) or widely
reproduced using open data, contradicting results are not difficult to
find and confirmation bias is easily served. Moreover, intellectual
property laws restrict our capabilities to harness produced knowledge
(e.g., questionnaires) or limit the utilization of computing power for
dealing with the ever increasing information overload in science. On
top of all of this and more, systemic factors resulting in explicit
and implicit individual or institutionalized ableism, ageism,
classism, homophobia, racism, sexism, and transphobia multiply these
struggles for already underrepresented scientists, making it probable
they become even more underrepresented as time passes.

<!-- , excluding many researchers from publishing with specific -->
<!-- brands (journals), which remains important for [career --> <!--
opportunities](https://peerj.com/preprints/27638) and --> <!--
misschien volgorde reflecteren aan vorige paragraaf --> How can anyone
create or expect valid, reproducible, and applicable knowledge if we
work in an exclusionary system that hampers diversity of backgrounds
and ideas, which discourages us to look at all of science and society
intersectionally, where we have inherently selective access to already
biased publications, where research behavior is increasingly
surveilled for commodification, we are increasingly burdened with
individual debt, and competition forces us to publish in a way that
causes the natural selection of bad science? Problematically so, these
are the conditions in which we are determining (amongst others) what
drugs to test on animals and subsequently humans, how to change our
policies, how to plan our cities, how to manage our crops, and how to
build our institutions.

After five years of research on understanding and improving the
sustainability of science, I see no way around it: We need new systems
to address these systemic issues simultaneously for everyone instead
of fiddling with minor knobs when we are allowed to and instigate
unequal development. Giving virtual stickers for sharing data is just
not going to cut it when we talk about the sustainability of science
in an encompassing way and egalitarian way.

If we want substantial change in science, we need to start building
parallel scientific systems that seek to address all of its known
issues in the broadest sense. In order to do this we need to integrate
the critical study of scientific practices with critical studies of
society, economics, organisations, information technology, and other
relevant fields. Only that way will we be able to determine the proper
scope of the issues that we need to address.

We can use parallel structures to do more than simply shift the power
to a new generation; we can use it to restructure and distribute
power. To restructure power in such a way that when we learn about the
immanent problems of the new systems we build, they can be more easily
addressed. To distribute power such that those traditionally
underrepresented finally become adequately represented.

What should we demand of a parallel scientific system to make it a
worthwhile undertaking in the first place? These demands can help
formulate utopian expectations to strive towards.

A worthwhile alternative scientific system must be widely applicable;
usable on its own and in parallel with the current structures people
might already be embedded in. This would allow double participation
for researchers in institutions and does not force (early career)
academics into zero-sum decisions that effectively exacerbate the
institutionalized issues they are already facing. Researchers outside
of academic institutions should not be forced to conform to the norms
of the institutions that they are not a part of (or may have actively
rejected if they left academia).

Beyond minimizing barriers to participation in the scientific system,
a worthwhile alternative must facilitate everyday research practices
in the most concrete way. Too many proposals for change in the
scientific system simply add to the already overburdening research
process, making it more difficult to do and participate in research
instead of less difficult. Especially, (quick) technocratic fixes are
a problem: technocrats formulate rules to create a veil of progress,
telling people what to do and not how they might go about doing
so. Additionally, technocratic measures are inherently
institution-specific and affirm top-down control mechanisms. A
worthwhile alternative must go beyond top-down rules and make it
easier to organize information, retrieve it, discuss it, and use it in
the most concrete, everyday sense.

Alternatives must provide a coherent and extensive answer to the
functions of a scholarly communication system. These functions
encompass access, registration, certification, archival, and
incentives. By analyzing the limitations of the current system on
these functions, we can design an alternative that differentiates
itself substantially and completely. By providing a more coherent
answer to these functions, it may also prove more convincing as the
most adequate option for a bottom-up change.  <!-- For example,
registration is --> <!-- incomplete due to biased publication. -->

<!-- Stepwise research -->
<!-- communication helps manage project progress and prevents fooling -->
<!-- oneself. By preempting the traditional publication stage, the -->
<!-- possibility arises to communicate diverse sources of content in the -->
<!-- same place. This must include things that are vital; data, code, -->
<!-- materials are all key and communicable steps of research. By -->
<!-- preempting traditional publications, researchers receive full autonomy -->
<!-- and responsibility about when and what to communicate instead of third -->
<!-- parties. All of this makes it possible to communicate research at any -->
<!-- time, anywhere, in more ways, removing artificial hurdles .  <\!-- not -->
<!-- make it more subject to audits etc -\-> -->

A conscious renewal of values in science must occur and must be
actively embedded in designs of an alternative scientific
system. Incrementality, validity, reliability, and replications must
become preferred over innovativeness, unreliability, and spontaneous
isolated discovery as a result. There is nothing objective about what
we subjectively decide to value. Only deep and active value changes
allow for science incentive superstructures that substantially
differentiate from the current and problematic system.  <!-- hier kan nog wel
geschrapt worden, best wat herhaling -->

Access to- and reuse of information must be complete and unlimited,
further removing barriers to participating in research. Unlimited
access and reuse means that intellectual control and censorship of
information by state, commercial, or other actors needs to be
mitigated by design. These actors benefit from bottlenecks in
information flow that can be tightened, controlled, and
surveilled. This is exactly how the services we now use are (being)
designed. Hence, current centralized and restrictive models need to be
replaced for decentralized and permissive models.

We must demand better ways to deal with information overload. Full
access and unlimited reuse permits us to deal with information
overload in better ways by making it easier to commodify ways to
consume and discover information. Creating such a market was part of
the European Digital Single Market strategy, but it failed to do
so. Oligarchic control over access and reuse prevents this market from
existing today. By demanding decentralization and distribution of
information, we may break up the oligarchic publishing structures in
science and oligarchic control over the data on which services to deal
with information overload can be built. With this, we may start to
understand, evaluate, and learn about the content we cannot possibly
read manually.

To better deal with information overload we must also demand new
information structures. Transparency is often proposed as the key to
reforming science, but without any structure to what is being made
transparent there is a risk of obfuscation through overload instead of
clarification through understanding. I have spent many hours trying to
understand someone else's project structure with hundreds of
files. This does not scale for sustainable information consumption and
production. Questions about the unit of communication and what is
communicable seem timely. At the same time as we create new
information structures, we must demand flexible schema's that allow
for heterogeneous ways of conducting research and prevent rigidity
that homogenizes and may even straitjacket research.

Due to the delicate balances and interests that need to be sought, we
must demand that these systems are built in an open, dialectical, and
actively inclusive way. It is unacceptable to create new (temporary)
exclusionary privileges in an attempt to make progress [e.g., the
temporary Open Access privilege the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
created; @doi:10.1038/nature.2017.21486]. This means that any form of
oligarchic control over how these demands are implemented needs to be
actively prevented and bottom-up procedures need to actively be
promoted.  <!-- An --> <!-- inclusive and open dialectic, if it
results in improved participation, --> <!-- may prevent groupthink and
centralized control in what paths --> <!-- alternative systems take.
--> <!-- Conversely, increasing exploitation of specific groups to -->
<!-- make progress on a domain is also unacceptable (for example, a
shift --> <!-- towards increased usage of MTurk workers [not
volunteers] who get paid --> <!-- below minimum wage, to increase
statistical power).  -->

We must demand systems that are sustainable for both
knowledge production and the environment. Servers provide us with all
kinds of digital services or are used to train machine learning
algorithms, utilized in services. These consume substantial amounts of
energy and are still often fossil-fuel based. In order to reduce
emissions, we must also start imagining other kinds of researcher
interactions or change the valuation of conference participation to
reduce the need for face-to-face conferences and the accompanying
flights. Any radical alternatives must be evaluated on their
sustainability given the acute urgency of global warming.

These demands in their totality produce a broad framework to build
parallel structures that may start to substantially change the
sustainability of science. Many scientific issues intersect with the
societal issues that we are embedded in; ignoring this
intersection harms making sustainable change. Reformist changes often
lack this intersectionality by being highly specific, which ultimately
results in more effort spent to achieve the same goals. In that sense,
this framework is also useful to evaluate potential limitations of
(reformist) proposals.

My work in the past five years has convinced me that radical thinking
about the totality of current issues is necessary. Reformist thinking
is conditional on the current system, whereas radical thinking is
unconditioned. In that sense, reformist thinking accepts the very
system it is trying to change --- which makes perfect sense if one
explicitly or implicitly believes the current system mostly works (for
them). Conversely, radicalism does not condition itself on the current
system and reimagines what is necessary where it is necessary.

The fundamental question when choosing between reformism or radicalism
is whether one thinks the current system mostly works. I consider that
the current system, taken to its logical conclusion, does not work,
hence, is unsustainable. For that reason, radical thinking is the only
viable option. Nonetheless, there is a multiplicity of ways to think
radically and achieve these demands. With pluralism of radical ideas,
substantial change may happen. In the end, it does not matter who
makes the change, but that the change happens.
