  abstract    = "We need to make substantial changes to how we conduct
                 research. First, in response to heightened concern that our
                 published research literature is incomplete and untrustworthy,
                 we need new requirements to ensure research integrity. These
                 include prespecification of studies whenever possible,
                 avoidance of selection and other inappropriate data-analytic
                 practices, complete reporting, and encouragement of
                 replication. Second, in response to renewed recognition of the
                 severe flaws of null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST),
                 we need to shift from reliance on NHST to estimation and other
                 preferred techniques. The new statistics refers to recommended
                 practices, including estimation based on effect sizes,
                 confidence intervals, and meta-analysis. The techniques are
                 not new, but adopting them widely would be new for many
                 researchers, as well as highly beneficial. This article
                 explains why the new statistics are important and offers
                 guidance for their use. It describes an eight-step
                 new-statistics strategy for research with integrity, which
                 starts with formulation of research questions in estimation
                 terms, has no place for NHST, and is aimed at building a
                 cumulative quantitative discipline.",

The Task Force on Statistical Inference of the American Psychological Association (TFSI, APA; Wilkinson {\&} TFSI, 1999) addressed the use of significance testing and made recommendations that were incorporated in the fifth edition of the APAPublication Manual (APA, 2001). They emphasized the interpretation of significance testing and the importance of reporting confidence intervals and effect sizes. We examined whether 286Psychonomic Bulletin {\&} Review articles submitted before and after the publication of the TFSI recommendations by APA complied with these recommendations. Interpretation errors when using significance testing were still made frequently, and the new prescriptions were not yet followed on a large scale. Changing the practice of reporting statistics seems doomed to be a slow process.",

    abstract = {<p>We revisit the results of the recent Reproducibility Project: Psychology by the Open Science Collaboration. We compute Bayes factors—a quantity that can be used to express comparative evidence for an hypothesis but also for the null hypothesis—for a large subset (<italic>N</italic> = 72) of the original papers and their corresponding replication attempts. In our computation, we take into account the likely scenario that publication bias had distorted the originally published results. Overall, 75% of studies gave qualitatively similar results in terms of the amount of evidence provided. However, the evidence was often weak (i.e., Bayes factor &lt; 10). The majority of the studies (64%) did not provide strong evidence for either the null or the alternative hypothesis in either the original or the replication, and no replication attempts provided strong evidence in favor of the null. In all cases where the original paper provided strong evidence but the replication did not (15%), the sample size in the replication was smaller than the original. Where the replication provided strong evidence but the original did not (10%), the replication sample size was larger. We conclude that the apparent failure of the Reproducibility Project to replicate many target effects can be adequately explained by overestimation of effect sizes (or overestimation of evidence against the null hypothesis) due to small sample sizes and publication bias in the psychological literature. We further conclude that traditional sample sizes are insufficient and that a more widespread adoption of Bayesian methods is desirable.</p>},
